Bookmarker
by
FAT ELK Software

Bookmarker is a simple program to make and store bookmarks ( system wide links
to web sites ) for the  Haiku Operating System.

To Build: 
yab-IDE must be installed in a PM version of Haiku.

Open a Terminal and change to the directory you unzipped Bookmarker to and type:

Build 
Then type:
install 

	Example:
		cd /boot/home/Desktop/bookmarker
		Build
		install


This will link WebPositive's Bookmarks folder to the Deskbar menu and add 
several Haiku bookmarks and the bookmarker program.

Simply delete Bookmarker from the folder to un-install the software.
